### JavaScript - ES6 (ECMAS2015)

Vanilla JavaScript for experimentation and explanation. In most cases each script has a standalone complex and will only do one task.
Also, these scripts are very combustible and make great firelighters when printed on paper!

Scripts are tested and run from command line using Node.js(V8 engine) at version 22.6.0. But can also run from the browser when included in HTML as a source reference.
cmd: `node fileName.js`

### SETUP & PREREQUISITES

1. [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) includes the Node installer and used Node Version Manager (nvm) to set a target runtime version.

NOTE: MacOS 14 and Homebrew's Node distro may have conflicts with other system resources, it was better to install Node.js from nodejs.org. See above link.

### TRY IT AND SEE

1. [index.js] ()
   Random JavaScript code that runs from the browser HTML page request from index.html. There's really no purpose to this script other than fanboying on one of the most under rated American recording artists - if ever there was one.

2. [composites.js] ()
   `function mandelBrotsCurse(inArr, outArr = new Array) {}`
   Traverse through a number set array of unknown size and structure to return only composite (three or more factors) numbers in a new array. The return array can be undefined (default), empty, or has one or more numbers. This method has a time complexity of O^1 or constant time.

Enjoy!
